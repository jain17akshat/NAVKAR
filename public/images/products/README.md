# Product Images

This folder contains all product images organized by category.

## Folder Structure
- `/blazers` - Blazer product images
- `/men` - Men's clothing product images
- `/women` - Women's clothing product images
- `/kids` - Kids' clothing product images  
- `/general` - General product images for categories without specific images

## Naming Convention
Images should follow this naming convention:
- Men's products: `men-1.jpg`, `men-2.jpg`, etc. (up to `men-100.jpg`)
- Women's products: `women-1.jpg`, `women-2.jpg`, etc. (up to `women-100.jpg`)
- Kids' products: `kids-1.jpg`, `kids-2.jpg`, etc. (up to `kids-100.jpg`)
- Blazers: `blazer-1.jpg`, `blazer-2.jpg`, etc. (up to `blazer-100.jpg`)
- General products: `product-1.jpg`, `product-2.jpg`, etc. (up to `product-100.jpg`)

## Adding New Images
1. Ensure images are optimized for web (compressed, appropriate dimensions)
2. Follow the naming convention for the specific category
3. Place images in the appropriate category folder
4. Try to maintain similar aspect ratios (preferably 1:1 for product thumbnails)

## Image Guidelines
- Recommended size: 800x800 pixels (1:1 ratio)
- Format: JPG or WebP (preferred for better compression)
- Max file size: 200KB per image for optimal performance

## How to Add Your Images
1. Place your images directly in the appropriate category folder:
   - For men's products: `/images/products/men/`
   - For women's products: `/images/products/women/`
   - For kids' products: `/images/products/kids/`
   - For blazer products: `/images/products/blazers/`
   - For general products: `/images/products/general/`

2. Make sure to name them according to the convention mentioned above:
   - men-1.jpg, men-2.jpg, ... men-100.jpg
   - women-1.jpg, women-2.jpg, ... women-100.jpg
   - etc.

3. No code changes are required after adding the images - the application will
   automatically load them based on the filenames and paths.
